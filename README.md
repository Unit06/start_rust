Here I am outlining material on learning the language of Rust. It started with a course from the Udemy site and will be further refined as I study different tutorials.

## Udemy Description
Why learn Rust.

Rust is a blazingly fast, but at the same time easy to pick up language, designed for reliability and memory management. Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know and love, like Firefox, Dropbox, and Cloudflare, uses Rust.

According to the StackOverflow developer survey, Rust is the most loved programming language among developers, for the fourth year in a row.

This course teaches you:
- to install Rust on a PC or Mac
- the language basics like
  - functions
  - data types
  - variables
  - etc
- the fundamentals of
  - flow control
  - complex data types
  - exception handling
  - macros
  - etc
- advanced topics such as
  - memory management
  - ownership and borrowing
  - sructures and traits
  - concurrency
  - etc
- practical applications of all studied concepts
- plenty of projects to get you practicing the language

We will apply everything we learned through coding small applications to solidify what we are studying. We will go through all these topics and explain them in detail. We will also implement many coding examples to make sure you fully understand and are able to apply the concepts.

This course opens up many opportunities to work in a growing market, where your skills will be highly values by employers. There is a huge shortage of Rust skills, and you can claim the top spot.
